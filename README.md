# Python-Projects
A collection of python projects that range from small to larger scale projects. 
Here is where I will track my projects with a quick note on what each project does.

<br>
Simple_Virus_Model.py: 
    <br><p>Simple virus model using python. It is a loop that keeps going as long as the commit is true. Once the commit hits false, the program will stop.</p>

<br>

<br><p>Create simple heart that is filled in.</p>

<br>
 DNA_Model.py:
<br><p>A repeating model of the DNA strands</p>
